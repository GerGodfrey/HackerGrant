## Proposed Solution

## Platform Components

The Platform consists of the following main components:
1.	**C1:** This displays the main concerts and provides various search options to find other available events.
2.	**C2:** To ensure compliance with the established requirements, users will be required to log in to Spotify to verify their affinity with the artist.
3.	**C3:** Once authenticated, users can choose their preferred show and select a specific date on which the artist will perform.
4.	**C4:** After choosing the date, users can select the preferred zone and seat within the event venue.
5.	**C5:** Once the selections are complete, users will proceed to make the corresponding payment to acquire the chosen tickets.
Additionally, from the home screen, users who have purchased tickets in the pre-sale will be able to access additional features such as transportation, lockers, and mobile device chargers utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT).
6. **C6** This bot provides in-venue, real world feedback and functionalities. As of now, we can control a local plug, used as reference of having charging spots available for premium users in the venue, and another remote plug used to refer to the ability to use a locker for in-venue storage. This implements the substrate/robonomics network and is one of our most valuable components.
